What is an algorithm?
    - an algorithm is a set of well defined instructions used to solve a problem

Qualities of a good algorithm:
    - input and output should be precisely defined
    - each step in an algorithm should be clear & unambiguous
    - it should be the most efficient solution for the problem
    - it should not include computer code
    - it should be programming language independent

Example: algorithm to add two numbers

step 1: start
step 2: declare variables n1, n2 and sum
step 3: read values n1 and n2
step 4: add n1, n2 and assign the result to sum
step 5: display sum
step 6: stop



What are data structures?
    - a data structure is a type of storage unit
    - it is used to effeciently store and retrieve data from computer memory
    - a data structure is different from a data type
    - a data structure is a collection of data types arranged in a specific order
    - there are 2 types of data structures:
        -- linear data structure
        -- non-linear data structure

Linear data structure:
    - elements are arranged in a sequence one after the other
    - easy to implement
    - do not scale well
    - examples:
        -- array
        -- stack
        -- queue
        -- linked list

Non-linear data structure:
    - there is no specific sequence between the elements
    - instead elements are arranged in a hierarchical manner,
      where 1 element is connected to one or more elements
    - non-linear data structures are further divided into:
        -- tree: single parent node
        -- graph: multiple parent nodes
