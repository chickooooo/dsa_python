stack:
    - push
    - pull
    - peek

problem solving:
    - read the problem carefully
    - ask clarifying questions to better understand the problem
    - convert the word problem to a coding problem
    - prepare a strategy to tackle the problem (white board or pen paper)
    - communicate with the interviewer as you try to solve the problem
    - once you are ready with the solution,
    - prepare test cases to test your solution on (try to cover all edge cases)
    - ask the interviewer if you have missed on any edge cases
    - now you can code the solution
    - test your code on the test cases
    - once all test cases have passed, calculate the time and space complexity of your solution
    - if you have time left, try to improve the efficiency of your solution
